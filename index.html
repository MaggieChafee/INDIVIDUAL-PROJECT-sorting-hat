    <header>Welcome to Hogwarts!</header>
    <p>Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,
      But don't judge on what you see,
      I'll eat myself if you can find
      A smarter hat than me.
      You can keep your bowlers black,
      Your top hats sleek and tall,
      For I'm the Hogwarts Sorting Hat
      And I can cap them all.
      There's nothing hidden in your head
      The Sorting Hat can't see,
      So try me on and I will tell you
      Where you ought to be.
      You might belong in Gryffindor,
      Where dwell the brave at heart,
      Their daring, nerve and chivalry
      Set Gryffindors apart;
      You might belong in Hufflepuff,
      Where they are just and loyal,
      Those patient Hufflepuffs are true
      And unafraid of toil;
      Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw,
      If you've a ready mind,
      Where those of wit and learning,
      Will always find their kind;
      Or perhaps in Slytherin
      You'll make your real friends,
      Those cunning folk use any means
      To achieve their ends.
      So put me on! Don't be afraid!
      And don't get in a flap!
      You're in safe hands (though I have none)
      For I'm a Thinking Cap!</p>
