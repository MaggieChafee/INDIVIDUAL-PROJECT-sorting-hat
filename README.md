# Project Walk-thru:
In this project, I worked on combining elements from our NSS prework and the first four weeks of class to create a Harry Potter themed website that sorts visitors into houses and expels them to Voldemorts Army. A few of the explored elements include:
- Arrays and Array Methods
- Loops
- HTML and CSS
- Dynamically rendering content through Javascript
- Event Listeners
- Functions

# Features:

The Individual Sorting Hat Project features include:
- Having the sorting hat form generate after clicking the "Begin Your Journey" button
- Randomly assigning new "students" to a Hogwarts house and rendering to the dom through a Bootstrap card
- The ability to "expel" a student to Voldemort's Army. When this happens, the student's original card disappears and then reappears with the other expelled students. 
- The ability to sort the current students by their house.
